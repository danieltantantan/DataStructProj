# CS201Proj
## How to run
1. cd into the root folder of the implementation you want to try 
```shell
cd Trie-with-built-in-hashmap
```
2. Run the compile.bat to compile the classes
```shell
compile.bat
```
3. Run the run.bat with the specific search query that you want to search for. 
This will run ProcessCSV, which will then create the CSV file to be built into the trie.

```shell
run.bat "covid 19"
```
